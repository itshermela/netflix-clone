# Netflix Clone App
- This is a Netflix clone application made with React (and JavaScript ES6+).
- Some techniques explored in this project are:

      -  React Router
      -  custom hooks
      -  Context API
      -  compound functional components.
- Compound Components are used to ease the way for a parent component to communicate with its children.
- Styled Components are used for the CSS implementation.
